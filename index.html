      <h1> <center>The Evolution of Headphones</center></h1>
      <center><h5>Headphones have evolved significantly since their invention in the early 20th century. Originally large and bulky, they were primarily used by radio operators and telephone workers. In the 1950s and '60s, headphones became more compact and started gaining popularity among music listeners. The introduction of the Walkman in the 1980s made portable listening mainstream. In the 2000s, earbuds and wireless Bluetooth technology revolutionized convenience and mobility. Today’s headphones offer features like noise cancellation, smart assistants, and immersive audio, blending style with advanced tech for a seamless listening experience.
